        <h1>Not Very Good Search</h1>

        <p>NVGS is an expiremental search engine designed around humans not only as people seaking infromation, but also people creating documents, as well as the source of the index itself.</p>

        <p><a href="/search">Try Searching</a> but don't be surprised if the results are underwhelming, it's just stuff I've found interesting on the internet. In fact that's the whole point. The question is wether or not we can build an effective search index in an community effort, created by humans for humans, and thus filtering the wide swaths of slop that fill the internet today. Right now this is all co-located on a single server, but I'd like to explore ideas of a federated index to see if we can scale the system.</p>

        <p>For now, reach out to me at nvgs@conbere.org or <a href="https://github.com/aconbere/nvgs">checkout the code</a> if you're interested in the project and would like to know more.</p>
